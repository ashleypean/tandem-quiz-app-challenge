# Tandem Quiz App
Hi there! 	&#x1f44b; My name is Ashley Pean and this is my submission for the Tandem Apprenticeship. 

### How to Use
1. Clone the repository onto your local machine  

    ```git clone https://github.com/ashleypean/tandem-quiz-app-challenge.git```
    ---
2. Install all necessary the packages and dependencies. This project uses React, so you will need to have it installed in order for it to work.  
   **npm** 

    ```npm install```
    ---
   **yarn**  

    ```yarn add```
    ---
3. Run the app on your localhost  

    ```npm run start```
    ---
    
### Notes

I am currently working on hosting the application on AWS, if you are interested in seeing the progress on this project, feel free to **watch** or come back from time to time for periodic updates!
